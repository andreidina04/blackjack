# Blackjack Game (Python)

A simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python.  
Play against the computer, with a persistent score that updates after each round.

## How to Play
- You start with two cards, and the computer gets two cards (one visible).  
- On your turn, you can choose to **hit** (`y`) or **stand** (`n`).  
- The computer draws cards automatically until it reaches a score of 17 or higher.  
- The winner of the round is displayed, and the general score is updated.
